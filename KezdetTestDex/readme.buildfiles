The Ant build file (build.xml) will generate an appropriately signed jar from the output of the KezdetTestDex project.
To use this please provide a local.properties file specifying the location of the Android SDK e.g.

sdk.dir=c:\\android-sdk

Add and run the Ant task to build the resulting plugin jar file.
The file will be built to the bin directory.
