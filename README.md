Kezdet
======

Kezdet is a plug-in system for dynamic code loading on Android.
Plug-ins are built as signed jar files that implement a specific interface and are dynamically loaded into the application.
This allows a developer to add additional functionality to an Android application post deployment / submission to the Play Store.

Originally Kezdet was developed to extend the External Interface system in Adobe AIR.
This system whilst allowing access to native functionality was limited in that any additions would require a new APK build and re-submission to the Play Store.
As AIR itself is able to dynamically load content this resulted in an asymmetric situation and so Kezdet was born to address this.

Kezdet is the Hungarian word for inception (and in honour of TamasS): we have to go deeper :)
